# Shut The Box

## About

A web-based game inspired by the Shut the Box board game. This project saves user's names and scores in a database.

## The Rules

i. Each turn, you roll the dice (or die) and select 1 or more boxes which sum to the value of your roll.
ii. You will not be allowed to pick the boxes which you choose on subsequent turns.
iii. When the sum of the boxes which are left is less than or equal to 6, you will only roll a single dice.
iv. When you cannot make a move or you give up, the sum of the boxes which are left gives your score.
v. Lower scores are better and a score of 0 is "shutting the box".
